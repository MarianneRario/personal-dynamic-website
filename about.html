                  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
                  <p>I'm Marianne Rario, a BSIT student. I am an academic scholar here at JRU and I pursue to be a scholar until I finish college. I would like to become a Software Engineer someday in a well-known tech company here in the Philippines. I am a hard working student and really dedicated into computer programming because for me it's really fun and challenging. Coding is a real passion of mine. Aside from coding or programming, I also love any art-related things especially painting and I'm really good at it. I also love to train my brain with not just programming but also with playing a variety of musical instruments like piano and guitar.</p>
                  <p>I'm not really an out-going person, I just love to study and do things that don't require a lot of physical efforts such as reading books, programming, office-related works, playing instruments and such, that is why I love online schooling because I don't need to walk or get properly dressed. I just saved so much effort when I'm at home really. Though I said I love reading books, I'm just interested with the Bible because it is the best educational book of all time. The Bible is the collection of books that is written by prophets, apostles, kings, evangelists that is being appointed by God. I really have an intense desire to learn the Bible and everything about it - from the best translations out there to what is the best religion which really teaches the pure gospel of Christ.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="col-md-6">
                  <img src="img/me.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid rounded-circle d-none d-md-block about-img">
               </div>
               <p class="ml-3">
                  Before, I don't think that there is any religion out there that could fulfill and satisfy my intense thirst with the word of God. Which I believe that is truly happening because it is written by Amos in his book Amos chapter 8 verse 11 this: <i>"11 Behold, the days come, saith the Lord God, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord...".</i> So, I believe this is now the time that we are experiencing this dilemma of thirst for the word of God. Luckily, I found Ang Dating Daan on television, and since then, I've always tuned in to watch their Bible Study. In fact, this is one of the things that I do everyday that greatly consumes my time, but I don't regret it. I'm really interested in the word of God and this is written as well in the Bible, in John chapter 4 verse 47: "He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God". If I'm not programming, then there is a 92% chance that I am busy listening with the word of God being preached by Bro.Eli Soriano.

                 <p class="ml-3">
                  Maybe my life is not that interesting like many of you but one thing I can say is that I'm pretty happy where I am right now. It is true that there's a lot of problem because we live in the perilous time, but I always hold on to what God said to Apostle Paul which he said to the members of the Church of God in Greece (Philippians): <i>"Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus"</i>. To God be the glory!
